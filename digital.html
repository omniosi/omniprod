        <h2>Poland Spring</h2>
        <h3>Origin</h3>
        <h4>Website landing page Redesign</h4>
        <p>The existing, introductory web page for the new Poland Spring Origin product was a collection of images with text baked in to each image. This approach made the page harder to maintain, kept the page low in organic search rankings, and inaccessible to some readers and non-compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines.</p>
        <div class="steps">
          <div class="process">
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>I redesigned the page in Figma, thinking mobile-first as analytics data showed our consumers overwhelmingly visited the Poland Spring site on their phones. I reused the photos, as there was no new photography, and pulled a new nature photo from the packaging print mechanical. The layout was planned with responsive coding in mind, to reuse images and re-arrange sections. Each image was exported at desktop size and optimized for quality and fast downloads.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="results">
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>The page redesign launched on time and increased organic search results by as much as 294% in the first year. This redesign earned a Shorty Award, the first award for our internal agency.</p>

        <h4>Homepage Takeover Ad</h4>
        <p>I was approached to create this animation, after the team couldn’t get the destructive text animation quite right. I worked directly with the ad publisher and nytimes.com to make sure that this home-page takeover ad performed perfectly.</p>
        <div class="steps">
          <div class="process">
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>Animation created in Adobe Flash with ActionScript code for the vendor’s custom ad server code. Files uploaded to FTP server for delivery to outside vendor for deployment.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="results">
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>The attention to detail in this animation, the ability to get up to speed quickly, and work well within the newyorktimes.com submissions guideline, and finally, the quick turnaround on my portion of this project solidified me as a go to designer, and developer, for the Canon team at Grey New York. This led to my role in future projects as a Creative Technologist.</p>

        <h4>3D-printed Trophy</h4>
        <p>Part of my role as a Creative Technologist in advertising was evangelizing new technologies to spark our creatives. To this end, we created an internal design competition to concept a physical object to benefit one of our clients. Every contest needs a prize, so I created a trophy that pushed the technology.</p>
        <div class="steps">
          <div class="process">
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>For reference, I created a series of photos, from various angles, of an existing, table-sized, art piece. Then modeled each 3D object in Autodesk Tinkercad. Each part of the sculpture had to be exported separately to insure print quality. The trophy pieces were printed with the Makerbot Replicator 2. Pegs and holes were added so that the final object was assembled without the need for glue.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="results">
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>Housed in a clear plexiglass case, this trophy was proudly displayed on the desk of the contest winner. The additive-technology print itself was good enough to impress even the Makerbot representatives, on hand for the judging of the competition. This project was a chance to learn 3D printer and grow my 3D design skills.</p>

        <h4>Scroll-animated Parallax web page</h4>
        <p>Splitting a custom illustration into a responsive, parallax animated-while-scrolling web page made this project a lot of fun to work on. The small team of Art Director, myself as UI Designer plus Front-End Developer, and a Javascript Developer, worked tirelessly on precise scroll-position animations while adding hidden easter eggs into this experience.</p>
        <div class="steps">
          <div class="process">
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>Converting vector-based illustrations into website designs, then coding as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Working with the brilliant Russell Weiss who made the parallax scrolling work across all browsers, with fallbacks for browsers that wouldn't allow for the scrolling animation. Uploaded final code to the Red Lobster server for deployment on their site.</p>

        <h3>Baby Accessories</h3>
        <h4>e-commerce website</h4>
        <p>Starting from the logo design for this stylish baby accessory brand, I was able to match a sense of fun with practically, which is exactly the brand ethos of the client. Creating the logo, the website design, and then coding a  static version of the site as reference for the Shopify/Magento developer to add the e-commerce functionality.</p>
        <div class="steps">
          <div class="process">
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>Layout in Adobe InDesign with image retouching in Photoshop. Created approved designs in HTML and CSS. Handoff of final coded layouts to Back-end Developer to incorporate Shopify e-commerce functionality.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="results">
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>The fun and versatile logo inspired new uses on the physical product; from labels and stamps to plans of a stuffed, plush toy. The website design immediately led to sales and was featured in press for the company.</p>

        <h4>Interactive teaching tool</h4>
        <p>Taking the remote-working model to its furthest extreme, I proposed an enhancement to this audio-only, language-learning product by prototyping, presenting, and selling this service, all while never once meeting the clients in person.</p>
        <div class="steps">

            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>Created art in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, then synced Motion Design Animation to client audio in AfterEffects. I created a series of demo web interactions, then provided them as both as web video and as downloadable MP4 files. Compressing files for quality and quick download time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="results">
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>The interactive prototypes led to presentations with airlines as a possible partnership for in-flight, business-class, educational content for seat-back screens.</p>
